# Summary

The paper is a literature review of flow experience in the context of video
games and aims to present the state of the art in the field.

The paper summarizes its goal as the following research question:
    - What is the current overview of the research involving the Flow Theory
      applied to digital games?
More specifically, the paper investigates how the literature answers the
following more practical questions:
    - How to evaluate the flow of a player?
    - How to enhance the game flow experience?

The paper describes the criteria to choose the review sources and the process
to shrink from a total of 1624 down to 30 works that have been reviewed
entirely.
Most works evaluate the flow experience through questionnaires and interviews
with players, and identify the balance between the game challenge and player
skills as the main flow enhancing factor.

# Evaluation

Overall, the paper is too descriptive and lacks more critical evaluation of the
literature.

Each section is reviewed in separate as follows.

## Introduction

Most of the introduction focus on the popularity and relevance of video games.
I would expect, however, a focus on the importance of flow experience in
general and specifically applied to video games.
Also, the research topic is only properly introduced late in Section 2.
I recommend to merge (parts of) the two sections and spend most of the space
introducing the flow experience and arguing about its relevance in the field.

The contributions and limitations of the paper are not clear at the end of the
introduction.
The research questions are only revealed in page 4 (!).
The introduction lacks more explicit goals and hints about the final
contributions of the paper.

## Flow

This section is too small and some parts could possibly be merged with the
Introduction.
The last paragraph could be expanded to explain the nine key elements in some
extent.
They seem to be of great importance to better grasp the concept of flow.

## Systematic Literature Overview

We all know what a literature overview is and also its importance.
The introduction uses a full page to discuss this aspect.
This space could be used to justify some choices that are only enumerated in
the paper.
For instance, it does not justify the selected sources, conferences and
journals.
Are there only three important venues that relate to the research topic?
How relevant and influential are these sources?

Section 3.1 could be summarized in the introduction of the paper.

Some subsections are too small and also suggest the same hierarchical
importance of others (e.g., "3.3 Keywords" is at the same level as 4.1).

One criteria that does not seem to be taken into account is the actual quality
of the surveyed papers, such as impact and journal of publication.

## Analysis of the Systematic Literature Review Results

The goals of the subsections are clear, but the contents are not directed to
meet these goals effectively.
After reading the sections, I still cannot answer concisely the posed
questions.
For instance, "What is the current overview of the research involving the Flow
Theory applied to digital games?".
The contents of the sections are superficial summaries on the state of the art
but lack critical insights and relationships between the works.
I miss some direction or story or general guideline in the review, linking the
works.

The whole section is too descriptive of the methodology in the literature,maybe
some more concrete examples could be used instead.
For instance, the paper enumerates questions/items/dimensions/criteria but does
not discuss them further. Which questions exactly ? What is the nature of the
questions? What are the typical answers that allow authors to draw conclusions?
What is in common and not in common among them? Are there concrete examples
that would suggest evidences to the conclusions?

I also found the division of paragraphs in this section somewhat confusing.
Some paragraphs summarize a single paper, some encompass multiple papers, and
some papers encompass multiple paragraphs.
The structure is not clear and does not help on reading the paper.

After reading each subsection, I was not sure about the conclusions in the end
of the sections.
As an example, in Section 4.3, 9th paragraph:
    "The balance between player skills ad game challenges is very important in
     this theory, and it is considered the key elements in many studies..."
None of the previous paragraphs in the section mention this balance.
How did the paper reached this conclusion that they are "very important" and
"key elements"?
Also, "this does not mean that the other elements can be considered as being of
less importance". Which other elements? So, they have the same importance?
The conclusions avoid strong opinions and assertions:
The terms "many variables", "non-trivial", "complex task", "particular to each
player", all appear in the same sentence and are evasive about the conclusions.

## Conclusion

The conclusion is well written.
