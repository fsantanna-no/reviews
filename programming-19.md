# Summary

The paper presents TaskFlow, a domain-specific language built on top of iTasks
for "task-oriented programming".
The goal is to offer a language more palatable for non programmers.
The approach is to offer interchangeable textual and visual representations of
programs.
The central concept of the language are "Tasks", which represent functional
combinators that use typed links to form a workflow.
The main combinators are sequences, conditionals, and forks.

# Evaluation

The paper is easy to follow and very descriptive about the proposed language.
However, I missed a more critical vision of the presented ideas in comparison
to related work.
In particular, since the work is based on iTasks, I would expect some code
snippets for the same guiding example for a more concrete comparison.

The paper assumes that "Task Oriented" is a known paradigm, but it seems that
iTasks is the only language to explicitly embrace it.
In order to better motivate the paper, I would expect a more elaborated
introduction to business processes, workflows, and the whole idea of
task-oriented programming.
Overall, the proposed language seem to be excessively tighted to iTasks



mentioned in the paper is 


loops?

- no independent idea from itasks

- "Task oriented programming"
    - paradigma com uma unica linguagem?

- Comparação com iTasks
    - qual a relevância disso?

- Ver o que eu escrevi sobre o trabalho do aluno do Wolf

- concurrency in stores

- diff entre args e contexto
    - ex, uma das setas mostra mesmos ids em ambos

- descritivo, pouco critico

- exemplo de paralelismo

- discussao sobre expressividade
    - o que nao é possível fazer?

- apenas um exemplo
    - sem testes com pessoas
    - nenhum outro tipo de evaluation

- no high-level description of the semantics

- internal events
