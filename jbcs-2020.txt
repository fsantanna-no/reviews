Firstly, two general observations about the text:
    - All citations appear as [?], being impossible to check them. This issue is very easy to spot and I can't see a reason that explains why the paper was submitted as is.
    - The English used in the paper needs a considerable revision. Nevertheless, it was possible to understand the text.

# Summary

The paper proposes a new method to generate verification monitors from LTL specifications.
The method relies on existing technology such as JavaMOP and SPOT.
The proposed translation method uses 6 steps: (1) inverses the LTL specification, (2) uses SPOT to generate an NBA, (3) reduces the state space with fair simulation, (4) obtains an NFA, (5) obtains a DFA, (6) generates the monitor with JavaMOP.
The experimental results show an improvement around 10% percent of time and memory considering 4 testing properties.
                                                                                
# Evaluation

The reasoning behind the proposed steps is never discussed, so it is hard to understand why this method has been proposed in the first place.
Is it just to minimize the number of states?                                    
Does it affect the exponential behavior of the original method?                 
Why the proposed method inverses the LTL but not the original method?           
In the new method, the conversion from LTL to NBA uses SPOT, which seems to be a third-party tool.
However, it is not clear how the original method makes the same conversion (maybe internally in JavaMOP?).
Is it possible that this introduced tool is also responsible for the improvements in performance?

The actual scientific contribution of the paper is not very explicit. Is it only the method arrangement in 6 steps? If so, what is the actual insight?
Even though the paper shows gains in performance, they are mostly under 10% in comparison with the original method. In some cases, the gains are negligible.
Also, the benchmark is composed of only 4 properties which were never justified.
Why did you choose these specific properties? Why only four?
