# Summary

The paper describes the experience of using an online learning platform in
Portuguese.
The platform is based on OCAML and was used during the pandemics with 300
students with different levels of knowledge (1st-3rd years).
The platform is web based and aggregates an IDE, exercises, auto correction,
theory, class management, etc.
The experience is still going on but the results are positive.

# Evaluation

The topic is relevant considering the current scenario of remote classes.
The scope of the paper is very broad and I could not extract the actual
contributions of the paper.
For instance, what exactly does "o resultado foi muito positivo" mean?
What are the metrics to be considered? What is to be evaluated and how?
It it the tool, the methodology, or the chosen programming language?
It is not clear if the authors participate in the development of the learning
platform or to what extent they made modifications to it.
Assuming the teaching methodology is an expected contribution, it is not clear
how the class activities evolve during the period.
A concrete scenario could be valuable.
For instance, how do teachers and students interact during the week.
The choice for the tool and language was never justified or compared to other
alternatives.
