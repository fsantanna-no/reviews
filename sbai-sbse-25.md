# Summary

The paper proposes a monitoring system to acquire and process data on the
usage and operational conditions of forklifts.
The goal is to improve the safety, efficiency, and maintenance management
of these vehicles in the industrial environment.
The solution monitors many properties, such as routes, operation hours,
integrity, speed, and operator access.
The solution relies on many technologies, such as 4G, Traccar, temperature
sensoes, inductive sensors, RFID readers.
The solution centralizes all collected data on a single platform using Traccar,
allowing access and analysis of data for strategic decisions.

# Evaluation

Even though the term IoT is recent, the use of telemetry in the automation
industry is pervasive.
For this reason, it is not clear what is the scientific contribution of
the paper.
The paper is interesting and well written, but I'm not convinced of its
novelty in scientific terms.

The section on related work ("Preliminaries") makes an overall description
abot the area of IoT for industrial vehicles.
However, there is no objective comparison with the proposed system.
It is not clear what exactly is missing in the state-of-the-art that this
work overcomes.
As a minor remark, the header "System Implementation and Testing:" has no
accompaining description.

The paper poses some scientific questions as follows:
"While IoT-enabled vehicle accident detection systems show promise in
improving road safety, challenges such as data privacy, system scalability,
and integration with existing infrastructure remain."
However, these challenges are not discussed elsewhere.
In particular, the "Results" section is only descriptive and makes no
scientific discussions.

The "Methodolgy" section, which is the core of the paper provides many
technical details about the system implementation, but again is only
descriptive with no scientific discussions.

In the opion of this reviewer, the paper describes a sound design and
implementation of a telemetry system for industrial vehicles, but with
no aparent scientific contributions.
