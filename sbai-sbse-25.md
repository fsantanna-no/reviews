# Summary

The paper proposes a monitoring system to acquire and processe data on the
usage and operational conditions of forklifts.
The goal is to improve the safety, efficiency, and maintenance management
of these vehicles in the industrial environment.
The solution monitors many properties, such as routes, operation hours,
integrity, speed, and operator access.
The solution relies on many technologies, such as 4G, Traccar, temperature
sensoes, inductive sensors, RFID readers.
The solution centralizes all collected data on a single platform using Traccar,
allowing access and analysis of data for strategic decisions.

a secao 2 faz uma discussao abstrata, sem comparar com o trabalho proposto

System Implementation and Testing: esta faltando texto?

qual o objteivo dessa secao?

a divisao das subsecoes nao esta clara

por exemplo, a proposta vai tratar disso?

While IoT-enabled vehicle accident detection systems
show promise in improving road safety, challenges such
as data privacy, system scalability, and integration with
existing infrastructure remain.
