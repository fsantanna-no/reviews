# Summary

The paper evaluates the speed and energy efficiency of WebAssembly in
comparison to JavaScript and C.
It compares 10 sorting algorithm varying the input size.
The results show that WASM is consistently more efficient than JS, but to a
small fraction.

# Evaluation

The paper is well written.
The scope is well determined as well as the limitations of the evaluation.
I wonder how difficult it would be to add much more examples and input sizes.
A larger set would strengthen the conclusions.
The abstract, introduction, and conclusion could be more explicit about the
gains with WASM.
I could only spot the exact numbers at the end of the discussion.
I also expected to see what were the expectations before the evaluation.
Even in related work these numbers do not appear, but only abstractly ("much
better", "much more", "very differently").
The paper argues about its infancy, but does not discuss why and to what extent
WASM's performance could improve.
