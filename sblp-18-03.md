# Summary

The paper proposes "AsyncRFJ", a functional reactive language built on top of a simplified and formalized version of Java (Java Featherweight).
The goal is to support reactive dataflow in the context of object-oriented programming.

The paper questions the effectiveness of object orientation for reactive programming and raises awareness for more declarative alternatives to describe data dependencies with automatic updates.

Then, the paper gives some background about Elm and Featherweight Java (FJ), the two languages that are used as the basis of the proposal.

The core of the paper is the formalization of AsyncRFJ: how it extends the original FJ (e.g., with closures), its core syntax, type system rules, and small-step operational semantics.

Finally, the paper shows a simple example and proofs for subject reduction and type soundness.

# Evaluation

The paper is very well written and shows that a significant amount of work has been employed in the proposed language.
The language is also fully formalized and has a working implementation.
The paper also demonstrates that the authors have a solid background and knowledge about the area of research.
The use of consolidated previous work as its basis is also notable.

The ineffectiveness of callbacks and similar approaches to program reactive systems is a well-known problem and I like that the paper does not spend much time revisiting it.

I found the text to be too dense for a 8-page conference paper.
The syntax and semantics of the language is placed in the text with not much explanations around them.
It doesn't seem possible to appreciate all aspects of the language unless one has fluency with formalization of functional reactive languages.
I'd rather see an informal discussion about the language and a deep comparison with related work.

However, the main reason to be inclined to reject the paper is related to the unclear expectations about its goals and contributions.
The paper concludes that previous approaches to combine OO with FRP have been attempted but "still lack systematic investigation of the interaction between OO features and reactive abstractions".
It is not clear for me how the proposed language addresses that challenge.
Is it the fact that it has a formal semantics? Is this enough?
The paper lacks a discussion about the interaction between OO and FRP.
The toy example in the paper seems to be fully functional with no use of OO features at all.
The related work section is only descriptive and does not compare the proposal with other attempts. It is also restricted to a few works, when this area has been explored in extent.
Overall, the motivation, goals, and contributions have to be much more explicit in the abstract and introduction.

## PROS

- Very well written
- Solid background
- Formalization and implementation
- Reuse of consolidated 3rd-party work

## CONS

- Lack of informal description or intuition or depiction for the semantics
- Unclear or lack of motivations, goals, or contributions
- Lack of deeper comparison with related work
- Lack of real uses or more complex examples
